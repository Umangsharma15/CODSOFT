Machine Learning Virtual Internship provides hands-on experience in applying ML techniques to real-world problems. During our internship, i worked on three key projects:

 1 : SMS Spam Detection – Developed a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (legitimate). Utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques and algorithms like Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or deep learning-based approaches.

 2 : Churn Prediction – Built a predictive model to analyze customer behavior and identify potential churners. Used data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks to improve accuracy.

 3 : Credit Card Fraud Detection – Created a fraud detection system using anomaly detection and classification techniques. Implemented models such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep Learning to detect fraudulent transactions with high precision.

Through this internship, i gained expertise in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and deployment techniques, preparing  for real-world machine learning challenges
